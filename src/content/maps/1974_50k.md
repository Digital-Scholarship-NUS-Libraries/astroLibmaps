## Series, Edition

Series SMU 050, Edition 1 SMU

## Description

A mosaic of 2 sheets of topographical maps of Singapore:

Sheet 1 (Singapore West): This map shows Singapore with detail on networks of roads and railways, international boundaries, water features, relief, buildings and vegetation. The coastline of Johor along the Straits of Johor is also shown.

Sheet 2 (Singapore East): This map shows Eastern Singapore with detail on networks of roads and railways, international boundaries, water features, relief, buildings and vegetation. The coastline of Johor along the Straits of Johor is also shown.

## Credits

This map was produced by the Mapping Unit, Ministry of Defence, Singapore, scanned by Sakinah Yusof, Department of Geography, National University of Singapore (NUS), georeferenced by Leon Gaw Yan Feng and mosaicked by NUS Libraries, with kind permission from Singapore Land Authority and Ministry of Defence for NUS Libraries to provide viewing of the map service over the internet.

## Georeferencing Notes

1. Georeferencing done on a data frame with WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere projected coordinate system.

2. Openstreet map (OSM) basemap was used for georeferencing road junctions while satellite imagery was used for geomorphological features.

3. Results

   - 1974 East (20 GCPs)

     First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 18.3477

     All GCPs are of road features like junctions, end points or inflexions.

   - 1974 West (20 GCPs)

     First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 15.9608

     19/20 of the GCPs are of road features like junctions, end points or inflexions.

     1/20 GCP are of geomorphological features (coastline of Pulau Bukom).

4. Issues

   - SVY_21 could not be assigned to .jpg images as these would result in an inconsistent extent.

     This problem did not occur with ArcGIS 10.2.

     The problem may also be a result of .jpg file format instead of .tiff.

   - Maps are more cluttered as the island of Singapore becomes increasingly urbanized.
   - 1974 maps had geographic information of Johor and some road junctions there were used for georectification.
   - Road intersections were the primary GCP used as the maps are more current and matches well with OSM data.
