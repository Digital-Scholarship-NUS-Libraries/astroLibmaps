## Georeferencing Notes

1. Georeferencing done on a data frame with WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere projected coordinate system.

2. Openstreet map (OSM) basemap was used for georeferencing road junctions while satellite imagery was used for geomorphological features.

3. Results (30 GCPs)

   - First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 23.561
   - 27/30 GCPs are of road features like junctions, end points or inflexions.
   - 3/30 GCPs are of geomorphological features like coastlines of southern islands.

4. Issues

   - SVY_21 could not be assigned to .jpg images as these would result in an inconsistent extent.

     This problem did not occur with ArcGIS 10.2.

     The problem may also be a result of .jpg file format instead of .tiff.

   - Maps are more cluttered as the island of Singapore becomes increasingly urbanized.
   - 1974 maps had geographic information of Johor and some road junctions there were used for georectification.
   - Road intersections were the primary GCP used as the maps are more current and matches well with OSM data.
