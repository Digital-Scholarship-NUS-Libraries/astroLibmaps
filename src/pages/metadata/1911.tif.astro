    <h3>Year of Publication</h3>
    <p>1911</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This map shows Singapore with detail on networks of roads, water features,
      surrounding islands and boundaries of the various districts. The coastline
      of Territory of Johore along the Old Strait or Silat Tembrau is also
      shown.

    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>
      This map was produced by the Geographical Section, General Staff,
      Singapore, scanned by Sakinah Yusof, Department of Geography, National
      University of Singapore, and georeferenced by Leon Gaw Yan Feng.

    <h3>Georeferencing Information</h3>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Georeferencing done with SVY21 projection.</li>
      <li>
        Openstreet map (OSM) basemap was used for georeferencing road junctions
        while satellite imagery was used for geomorphological features.
      </li>
      <li>
        18/28 GCPs are of road junctions
        <ul>
          <li>
            Road junctions georectified were primarily those of main roads
            radiating from the CBD as the small scale map made junctions in the
            CBD difficult to discern.
          </li>
          <li>
            Further, crowded labelling of roads in the CBD obscured junctions.
          </li>
          <li>
            According to the map legend (References), although some ‘Cart Tracks
            and Foot Paths’ lined up closely with modern roads, they were not
            georeferenced ue to their temporary and easily altered nature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overall, the road network shown on the map is unreliable and not
            extensive enough, especially in western Singapore, and must be
            supplemented by geomorphological GCPs for accurate georeferencing
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        10/28 GCPs are of geomorphological features
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unreclaimed coastlines of mainland Singapore and various offshore
            islands were used for georeferencing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offshore islands in the south were used to ensure an even spread of
            GCPs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The west coast of Singapore had no GCPs as the entire coastline had
            been altered to accommodate the western catchment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Transformation Method (27 GCPs)
        <ul>
          <li>
            First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 0.000850189
            <p>
              Coastlines in the north and main roads radiating from the CBD line
              up well.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Spline
            <p>
              A spline transformation results are satisfactory as the roads and
              coastlines on mainland Singapore line up well.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Issues
        <ul>
          <li>
            The shorelines of offshore islands were not drawn very accurately
            (P. Tekong Kechil and P. Pawai).
          </li>
          <li>
            Labelling of map features (especially roads) were poorly done as it
            obstructed them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional notes
        <ul>
          <li>
            It was decided that the coastline of Johor should not be used for
            georectification because the land survey used to derive this map
            focused on Singapore and coastlines of Johor may not be accurately
            drawn, which may affect the results of the georectification.
