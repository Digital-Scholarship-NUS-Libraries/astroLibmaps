    <h3>Georeferencing Information</h3>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Georeferencing done with SVY21 projection.</li>
      <li>
        Openstreet map (OSM) basemap was used for georeferencing road junctions
        while satellite imagery was used for geomorphological features.
      </li>
      <li>
        37/43 GCPs are of road junctions
        <ul>
          <li>
            Road network printed on the topographic map closely resembles modern
            roads, especially in mature estates like Queenstown, Bukit Timah and
            Geylang Serai.
          </li>
          <li>
            Road end points along stable coastlines also served as GCPs in
            Kranji an Punggol.
          </li>
          <li>
            Junctions of ‘Main Roads’ (as per map legend) served as reliable
            control points as roads lower in heirachy are too faint on map or
            may be temporary in nature such as tracks and footpaths.
          </li>
          <li>
            GCPs were not placed along the runway of Paya Lebar Airport as the
            runway has been heavily modified (lengthened and expanded) when
            converted to a military airbase.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        8/45 GCPs are of geomorphological features
        <ul>
          <li>
            Coastlines of offshore islands like P. Tekong, P. Ubin and the
            southern islands were used as GCPs as they are not subject to much
            modification compared to the coastline of mainland Singapore.
          </li>
          <li>
            GCPs were not placed on stippled coastlines as the exact boundary of
            the coastline is difficult to ascertain. Coastlines marked with a
            distinct blue line were preferred.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Transformation Method (45 GCPs)
        <ul>
          <li>
            First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 0.000296864
            <p>
              Coastlines of Singapore and its offshore islands as well as road
              networks line up properly.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            3<sup>rd</sup>order polynomial - RMSE: 0.000243437
            <p>
              Not much wrap involved which may distort the map as GCPs were
              evenly spaced throughout the map.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Issues
        <ul>
          <li>
            Areas in Tampines and Tuas were still undeveloped and hence lacked
            GCPs as there was no stable points of references there. i.e. The
            hills in Tampines would have been levelled and land in Tuas
            reclaimed from the sea.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional notes
        <ul>
          <li>
            Coastlines of offshore islands were more accurately drawn compared
            to the 1911 map of Singapore due to development and military
            interest in them.
