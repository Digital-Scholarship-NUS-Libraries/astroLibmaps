    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A mosaic of 2 sheets of topographical maps of Singapore:</p>
    <p>
      Sheet 1 (Singapore West): This map shows Singapore with detail on networks
      of roads and railways, international boundaries, water features, relief,
      buildings and vegetation. The coastline of Johor along the Straits of
      Johor is also shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheet 2 (Singapore East): This map shows Eastern Singapore with detail on
      networks of roads and railways, international boundaries, water features,
      relief, buildings and vegetation. The coastline of Johor along the Straits
      of Johor is also shown.

    <h3>Georeferencing Information</h3>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Georeferencing done on a data frame with
        WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere projected coordinate system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Openstreet map (OSM) basemap was used for georeferencing road junctions
        while satellite imagery was used for geomorphological features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Results
        <ul>
          <li>
            1974 East (20 GCPs)
            <p>
              First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 18.3477
            </p>
            <p>
              All GCPs are of road features like junctions, end points or
              inflexions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            1974 West (20 GCPs)
            <p>
              First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 15.9608
            </p>
            <p>
              19/20 of the GCPs are of road features like junctions, end points
              or inflexions.
            </p>
            <p>
              1/20 GCP are of geomorphological features (coastline of Pulau
              Bukom).

        Issues
        <ul>
          <li>
            SVY_21 could not be assigned to .jpg images as these would result in
            an inconsistent extent.
            <p>This problem did not occur with ArcGIS 10.2.</p>
            <p>
              The problem may also be a result of .jpg file format instead of
              .tiff.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Maps are more cluttered as the island of Singapore becomes
            increasingly urbanized.
          </li>
          <li>
            1974 maps had geographic information of Johor and some road
            junctions there were used for georectification.
          </li>
          <li>
            Road intersections were the primary GCP used as the maps are more
            current and matches well with OSM data.
          </li>
        </ul>
