    <h3>Georeferencing Information</h3>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Georeferencing done with SVY21 projection.</li>
      <li>
        Openstreet map (OSM) basemap was used for georeferencing road junctions
        while satellite imagery was used for geomorphological features.
      </li>
      <li>
        23/25 GCPs are of road junctions
        <ul>
          <li>
            Road networks on the map (South Singapore), where most junctions are
            found, are located in the Raffles Place and Bugis districts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Junctions are uncommon outside these areas and if they do appear,
            are no longer in existence today. Those used (and are still present
            today) are junctions of major roads today like Paya Lebar Road,
            Macpherson and Serangoon Road.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roads in Sentosa have changed altogether and hence were not used.
          </li>
          <li>
            No legend was given but roads highlighted in pink were preferred in
            georeferencing as they were major roads that still exist today.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        2/25 GCPs are of geomorphological features
        <ul>
          <li>
            They are the southern tip of Labrador Park and the western tip of
            Sentosa Island, the only features that have not been altered or
            reclaimed to date.
          </li>
          <li>
            In general, hills and coastlines were not used as they may be
            levelled or reclaimed, respectively, to accommodate development
            since 1846.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Transformation Method (25 GCPs)
        <ul>
          <li>
            First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 0.000344659
            <p>Roads on map align well with OSM base layer</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            2<sup>nd</sup> order polynomial - RMSE: 0.000286082
            <p>
              Not much difference in terms of alignment with the affine
              transformation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Spline
            <p>
              Roads in CBD do not align properly compared to the former two
              methods (see Outram Road).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Issues
        <ul>
          <li>
            Important to note, no GCPs were placed on the eastern corner of the
            map on purpose, east of +103.893DD, as that portion of map does not
            appear to align with the main map.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, Tanjong Katong Road is suddenly sheared south. However,
            the other features of the map like Tanah Merah Road and the Table
            seems to line up fine.
          </li>
          <li>
            It was decided that it is not worth the risk of distorting the map
            further by placing GCPs there as there are no features there
            reliable enough to.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional notes
        <ul>
          <li>
            Other transformation methods produced maps that were wrapped and
            distorted beyond recognition, especially in the south-eastern
            quadrant as there are no GCPs placed there (area of map occupied by
            “The Strangers’ Guide to the Environs of Singapore”).
