    <h3>Georeferencing Information</h3>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Georeferencing done on a data frame with
        WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere projected coordinate system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Openstreet map (OSM) basemap was used for georeferencing road junctions
        while satellite imagery was used for geomorphological features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Results (30 GCPs)
        <ul>
          <li>First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 23.561</li>
          <li>
            27/30 GCPs are of road features like junctions, end points or
            inflexions.
          </li>
          <li>
            3/30 GCPs are of geomorphological features like coastlines of
            southern islands.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Issues
        <ul>
          <li>
            SVY_21 could not be assigned to .jpg images as these would result in
            an inconsistent extent.
            <p>This problem did not occur with ArcGIS 10.2.</p>
            <p>
              The problem may also be a result of .jpg file format instead of
              .tiff.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Maps are more cluttered as the island of Singapore becomes
            increasingly urbanized.
          </li>
          <li>
            1974 maps had geographic information of Johor and some road
            junctions there were used for georectification.
          </li>
          <li>
            Road intersections were the primary GCP used as the maps are more
            current and matches well with OSM data.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
