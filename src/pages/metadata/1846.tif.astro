    <h3>Year of Publication</h3>
    <p>1846</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This map shows the demarcation and development of Singapore town and land
      use of its adjoining districts. This is the most detailed map of
      Singapore’s town of the time that is known. This map includes Singapore
      Town, Downtown, Chinatown, Little India, Malay Village, Raffles Place,
      Orchard, Tiong Bahru, Keppel Road, Telok Ayer, Bras Basah, Kallang, Tanah
      Merah, Singapore Harbour.

      This map was produced by John Turnbull Thomson, a Government Surveyor,
      Singapore and published by J.M. Richardson in London, scanned by Sakinah
      Yusof, Department of Geography, National University of Singapore, and
      georeferenced by Leon Gaw Yan Feng.

    <h3>Georeferencing Information</h3>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Georeferencing done with SVY21 projection.</li>
      <li>
        Openstreet map (OSM) basemap was used for georeferencing road junctions
        while satellite imagery was used for geomorphological features.
      </li>
      <li>
        19/21 GCPs are of road junctions
        <ul>
          <li>
            Majority were located in present-day Chinatown, Raffles Place and
            Bugis, located at the centre of the map. These were the first areas
            to be settled by the British and hence have the most extensive road
            networks that still exist today.
          </li>
          <li>
            To space out GCPs, junctions of arterial roads radiating to the
            other corners of Singapore were used and they are
            Kallang-Geylang-Tanah Merah Road, Serangoon Road, Bukit Timah Road
            and Pasir Panjang Road.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        2/21 GCPs are of geomorphological features
        <ul>
          <li>
            They are the southern tip of Labrador Park and the western tip of
            Sentosa Island, the only features that have not been altered or
            reclaimed to date.
          </li>
          <li>
            In general, hills and coastlines were not used as they may be
            levelled or reclaimed, respectively, to accommodate development
            since 1846.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Transformation Method (21 GCPs)
        <ul>
          <li>
            First order polynomial (Affine Transformation) - RMSE: 0.000421671
            <p>
              The 1846 road networks line up in all quadrants of the maps except
              in the north-western one (end of Bukit Timah Road) possibly due to
              distortion of the scanned image.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            *2<sup>nd</sup> order polynomial* - suggested - RMSE: 0.000289214
            <p>
              This transformation solves the issue of the distortion by aligning
              the end of Bukit Timah Road to where it should be without wrapping
              the map too much. The other road networks still are in accurate
              positions and are not affected too much by the higher degree.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Issues
        <ul>
          <li>
            Being new, the British settlement of Singapore did not have many
            roads spread across the map for georeferencing.
          </li>
          <li>
            The roads in the Kallang District in the north-east were more of
            plantation tracks that have given way to today’s Kallang industrial
            and HDB estate.
          </li>
          <li>
            As mentioned before, the fold in the north-western tip of the map
            produces distortions when georeferencing.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional notes
        <ul>
          <li>
            RMSE results are much lower than Isaac’s and Richard’s work as they
            used the projected co-ordinate system (PCS) of WGS84 UTM 48N while
            this map used a geographic co-ordinate system (GCS) of SVY21.
